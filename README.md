## 🧠 **AI Agent for Chronic Disease Monitoring**

**Capstone Project | IBM SkillsBuild | HealthTech Innovation**

---

### 🔍 **Overview**

In a world where chronic diseases like **diabetes, hypertension, and heart conditions** are on the rise, timely monitoring and intervention can mean the difference between stability and emergency. Our project introduces a **smart AI-powered agent** that revolutionizes how chronic illness is tracked and managed—**24/7, intelligently, and personally.**

---

### 💡 **The Problem**

* Chronic diseases demand **continuous care**, but most systems offer **reactive**, not **proactive** support.
* Patients struggle with **scattered health data** from wearables, reports, and symptom logs.
* Healthcare providers lack **real-time insights** and miss early warning signs.
* Result: **poor adherence**, **delayed action**, and **unnecessary hospitalizations**.

---

### 🚀 **Our AI-Driven Solution**

We developed a **real-time health monitoring system** using **IBM's cutting-edge AI & Cloud technologies** that:

✅ Integrates data from **wearables**, **medical history**, and **self-reported symptoms**
✅ Applies **predictive analytics** to detect early risk patterns
✅ Delivers **personalized insights**, **reminders**, and **lifestyle recommendations**
✅ Sends **alerts** for critical deviations (e.g., glucose spike or high BP)
✅ Bridges the gap between **patients** and **providers** for collaborative care

### ⚙️ **Technology Stack**

* 🌐 **IBM Cloud Lite** for scalable deployment
* 🤖 **IBM watsonx.ai Studio** with **Granity multimodal LLM**
* 📊 **Python Libraries**: `ibm_watsonx_ai`, `PIL`, `requests`, `textwrap`, etc.
* 🔍 **AI Model**: `meta-llama/llama-3-2-11b-vision-instruct` for processing both **numerical** & **visual** data
* 🧱 Architecture:
  `Input → Preprocessing → AI Inference → Output Dashboard & Alerts`

---

### 🔄 **How It Works**

1. 🩺 **Ingests Data**: Vitals (HR, BP, glucose), symptoms, images (like reports)
2. 🧠 **Analyzes** using AI model with natural language prompts
3. 📲 **Provides**: Risk level, suggestions, alerts, reminders
4. 🔄 **Repeats** via a continuous feedback loop

---

### 📈 **Impact & Results**

* Early detection of warning signs
* Improved medication adherence
* Reduced hospital visits
* Better patient engagement
* Scalable, secure, and low-cost health support system

---

### 🔮 **Future Scope**

* Extend support to more conditions: **COPD**, **kidney disease**, etc.
* Use **custom-trained AI models** for patient subgroups
* Integrate with **mobile apps** and **telehealth platforms**
* Support **edge computing** for offline, privacy-first data capture
* Employ **advanced wearables** (e.g., ECG patches, CGMs)
